      <h2>Welcome to Our Family's Special Getaway!</h2>
      <p>This cabin is filled with memories and equipped with everything we need for a comfortable stay. Here's a quick guide:</p>

      <h3>The Kitchen</h3>
      <p>Feel at home in our fully equipped kitchen. You'll find everything from a fridge to a coffee maker. Please clean up after use, so it's nice and tidy for the next family member.</p>

      <h3>Heat</h3>
      <p>For those chilly nights, adjust the thermostat in the living room. Extra blankets are in the bedroom – feel free to snuggle up!</p>

      <h3>Connected and Entertained</h3>
      <p>Stay connected with Wi-Fi (password on the fridge) and enjoy family movie nights with our smart TV and board games.</p>

      <h3>Keeping It Clean</h3>
      <p>Please use the bins for waste and remember, our septic system is a bit old-fashioned – so use toilet paper sparingly.</p>

      <h3>Fun!!!</h3>
      <p>Enjoy the patio on the nice days! There is a table and grilling supplies in the shed.</p>
      <p>There are board games, cards, and dominos to have a nice family game night!</p>
      <p>The yard makes for a great sled hill, just be sure to find a spot without trees.</p>
      <p>Don't forget to check out the sleds in the log cabin shed for some snowy adventures!</p>
